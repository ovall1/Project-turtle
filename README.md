### A collaborative soundtrCk recording project
This is a project started by [Wburon](profile-link) and [Ovall](profile-link) within the context of the lockdown for Covid19. 

We aim to start a music project in which every new commit is a new track on a single (for now) music file. Anybody willing to collaborate can for the project and add new tracks and if happy with the results can commit it to the project.
