# Project-turtle
### A collaborative soundtrCk recording project
This is a project started by [Wburon](https://github.com/wburon-m) and [Ovall](https://github.com/ovall1) within the context of the lockdown for Covid19. 
The aim is to start a music project in which every new commit is a new track on a single (for now) music file. Anybody willing to collaborate can for the project and add new tracks and if happy with the results can commit it to the project. Follow the insctrutiont hown to properly do this.


## How to collaborate
The project will have, as seen in the repository the following structure:
**turtle-song.mp3** (the latest song file which are all the previous tracks merged)
**Tracks** (A folder with all the simple tracks added into the master turtler-song.mp3 saved as different files.

We will ask you to preserve this structure when forking and commiting the project.
