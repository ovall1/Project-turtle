# Project-turtle
### A collaborative music track recording project
This is a project started by [Wburon](https://github.com/wburon-m) and [Ovall](https://github.com/ovall1) within the context of the lockdown for Covid19. 

We start with a music file/composition and then record tracks on top, so every new commit (by anybody) is a new track on a single music file. Anybody willing to collaborate can add new tracks and if happy with the results can commit them to the project. Follow the instructions on how collaborate.


## How to collaborate
The project will have, as seen in the repository, the following structure:

* **"00_master-turtle.mp3":** The latest song file which are all the previous tracks merged. Where "00" is going to be the version of the file. 
* **"Tracks":** A folder with all the single tracks merged into the master-turtle.mp3 saved as different files (and named as **"00_name-of-track.mp3"** and where 00 is the number of track within the whole project, so if last one was 03, yours will be 04).

We will ask you to preserve this structure when forking and commiting the project.

## Project config
The music file we will be working on has a **time signature of 4/4** and a **tempo of 90**. So make sure you set those in place when recording new tracks for it. For now is going to be 24 compasses long (which is a bit more than a minute long), we can consider expanding it time-wise if we need more 'space' in the future.
